# Spaceman
I chose this game because I played Hangman alot as a child and really enjoy it. Although I had never heard of Spaceman, it is essentially a different variation of the same game.

In the game, you are alloted a certain number of tries to guess the letters that make up a hidden word. Once you have successfully spelled the word or you have run out of tries, the games is over. There is usually a hint provided to help you in guessing as well.

The technlogies I used to build the game include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In the future, I would like to include sound to accompany the Win and Lose messages as well as a skip button to allow players to move ahead to the next word during gameplay.
